# ALX Interview Repo: Minimum Operations

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to the ALX Africa Intranet's Short Specializations Average. The project, 0x02. Minimum Operations, is part of the Algorithm curriculum. The goal is to implement a Python function that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to achieve a specific character count.

### Minimum Operations

Create a function `minOperations(n)`:

- Returns the minimum number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` characters of 'H'.
- Returns 0 if it's impossible to achieve the given count.

## Repository Structure

- **GitHub Repo:** [alx-interview](https://github.com/Josh-techie/alx-interview/tree/master/0x02-minimum_operations)
- **Directory:** 0x02-minimum_operations
- **File:** 0-minoperations.py

## Completion Status

Ensure completion of `0-minoperations.py`.

## How to Run

Execute `./0-main.py` to test your `minOperations` function.

```bash
$ ./0-main.py
Min number of operations to reach 4 characters: 4
Min number of operations to reach 12 characters: 7
```

## Requirements

#### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
