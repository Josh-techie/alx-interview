# Minimum Operations

## Overview

- This repository is dedicated to the ALX Africa Intranet's Short Specializations Average. The project, 0x02. Minimum Operations, is part of the Algorithm curriculum. In a text file, there is a single character `H`. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: `Copy All` and `Paste`. Given a number `n`, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n `H` characters in the file.

---

## Task

**Create a function `minOperations(n)`:**

- Returns the minimum number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` characters of 'H'.
- Returns 0 if it's impossible to achieve the given count.

---

## Repository Structure

- **Directory:** 0x02-minimum_operations
- **File:** [0-minoperations.py](./0-minoperations.py)

---

## How to Run

Execute `./0-main.py` to test your `minOperations` function.

---

## Test Script

```bash
$ ./0-main.py
Min number of operations to reach 4 characters: 4
Min number of operations to reach 12 characters: 7
```

---

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- All files end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A mandatory README.md file at the root of the project folder
- Code documentation and adherence to PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- All files must be executable
