### Table of Contents

- [Pascal's Triangle](https://github.com/Josh-techie/alx-interview/blob/master/0x00-pascal_triangle/0-pascal_triangle.py)
  - Create a function `def pascal_triangle(n):` that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal’s triangle of n.

- [Lockboxes](https://github.com/YourUsername/alx-interview/blob/main/0x01-lockboxes/0-lockboxes.py)
  - Implement a Python function `def canUnlockAll(boxes):` to determine if all the locked boxes can be opened. Given a list of locked boxes, each containing keys to other boxes, the function checks whether it's possible to open all the boxes. Return `True` if all boxes can be opened, and `False` otherwise.
